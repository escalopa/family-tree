# Fix

## Logic's page

- Cursor isn't being used correct, it must be send only if there is something more to fetch
- Nicknames aren't shown in the UI and not stored correctly in the backend, i see changes where nicknames was empty and then became null and the otherway back

## Member's page

- Age field isn't shown in the UI or not being sent from the backend on the member's page

## User's page

- Add a graph with time on X and points earned on Y, start and end
