# Fix

## Security page

- Update data to be encrypted even in DB (think if we need this)

## Extras

- Add support for mobile/tablet
- Add support for arabic language (and ideally to all languages)
- Show generation level relative to root
- Expand name feature to be avaliable for all languages, i.e. you can choose the language and set a name for this member in this specific language
- Add support for multiple porviders, backend has information about connected providers throught config, the passed configuration must support

## Tree

Now I need you to rework the whole tree view

Tree can be viewed in many forms
1) As a tree, this is the most core funcionallity, branches show relation between memebers, this might required expanding methods on backend and frontend
2) As a tree to show relation between exactly 2 memebers
3) List view

## TO FIX

- non super admins don't see the year of members, this might cause confusion to them despite the data is in DB, this might lead to overriding the real value
