# Fix

## Security page

- Update data to be encrypted even in DB (think if we need this)

## Extras

- Add support for mobile/tablet
- Add support for arabic language (and ideally to all languages)
- Show generation level relative too root
- Expand name feature to be avaliable for all languages, i.e. you can choose the language and set a name for this member in this specific language
